  What is not visible on the dashboard yet is optimisation graphs of select technical analysis indicators. Development on the slow stochastics optimisation function has recently begun. For visual aide, graphs have been included for a 3D dimension, two parameter optimisation. However, to tweak all the calculations for the slow stochastic indicator, around 6 variables (dimensions) need to be tested which cannot be shown.
